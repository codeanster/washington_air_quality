# Washington Air Quality Monitor

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) skills by collecting and processing air quality data for Washington state. It showcases the use of serverless architecture and API endpoints for efficient data handling and delivery.

## Technologies Used
- AWS Lambda: For periodic data collection and processing
- Amazon API Gateway: To create and manage API endpoints
- SQL: For data storage and manipulation through stored procedures

## Project Structure
The repository contains two main folders:
1. Data Collection Lambda Function
2. Data Delivery Lambda Function

## Features
- Automated data collection every 15 minutes using AWS Lambda
- API endpoints for data delivery, managed through Amazon API Gateway
- SQL procedures for efficient data manipulation and storage

## Future Plans
- Add more API endpoints for diverse data access
- Explore creative applications for the growing air quality database

## Note to Viewers
This project is a work in progress and primarily serves as a demonstration of ETL skills and cloud service integration. Some components may be incomplete or placeholder, reflecting the ongoing development nature of the project.
